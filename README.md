## ABOUT
This repository is included in the school project developed for my professional aptitude test required to pass my vocational course in computer systems management and programming.

## TECH
The repository uses Python 3.9 as the programming language for the model (SRCAM) with two versions, one for input and one for output.

The project uses a pre-trained model from [Tensorflow 2 Detection Models Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md).

More tech was used in the project such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to help train the model, [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) to identify the characters and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to visualise the data.
